Central repositories (orange) are for broad categories of ‘omics’ tools. If no catagory fits your scripts you may add a new repository.

Within each central repository each lab or research group maintains a directory (yellow). This allows researchers to search for scripts by lab or topic. Please add a directory for your lab the first time you add a script to central repository.

There is also a Readme.md (beige) within each central repository. This is a list of scripts with short descriptions. Please add to the list as you add scripts.
